# Welcome to vengi

This is a C++ voxel game engine and its tools. It includes a voxel editor with character animation support
and loading/saving into a lot of voxel volume formats. There are other tools like e.g. a thumbnailer for
your filemanager and a command line tool to convert between several voxel formats.

The project source code is located at [github/mgerhardy/engine](https://github.com/mgerhardy/engine). We also
provide debian and windows binaries here.
