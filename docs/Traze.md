# Traze

This is a voxel based representation of the traze game available at [traze.iteratec.de](https://traze.iteratec.de).

It uses mqtt for communication. The lib that is used for this is [mosquitto](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto).

This application can be used to spectate games and to play games. You can select all active games from the debug menu,
select one and decide at any time to join the game by hitting the button in the debug menu. Once you press the first WASD-key
to move your bike, you are joined.
