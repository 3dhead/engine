# General

This is about an mmorpg in a fantasy like world.

The world is an active simulation where you "jump" into characters (ala Avatar). You inherit the characters
abilities while you are jumped in. You learn some of the abilities in your own profile and can keep the abilities
to some degree when you jump out of the character again.

The world is divided by portals that connect islands. There is a max player amount on each island - limited by
the amount of characters you can jump into. Leaving an island just gives an overview of "free" other islands you
can travel to. And again you take your newly learned abilities with you - but not all of the characters'.
