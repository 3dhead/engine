	 * TODO: calculate the obb around the frustum - but we have to improve later anyway for cascaded shadowmaps.
	 * TODO: then create the ortho matrix from it. http://www.ogldev.org/www/tutorial49/tutorial49.html
	 *
	 * Potential Shadow Receivers, or PSRs for short, are objects which belong at the same time to the light frustum,
	 * to the view frustum, and to the scene bounding box. As their name suggest,
	 * these objects are susceptible to be shadowed : they are visible by the camera and by the light.
	 *
	 * Potential Shadow Casters, or PCFs, are all the Potential Shadow Receivers, plus all objects which lie between
	 * them and the light (an object may not be visible but still cast a visible shadow).
	 *
	 * So, to compute the light projection matrix, take all visible objects, remove those which are too far away,
	 * and compute their bounding box; Add the objects which lie between this bounding box and the light,
	 * and compute the new bounding box (but this time, aligned along the light direction).
	 *
	 * Precise computation of these sets involve computing convex hulls intersections,
	 * but this method is much easier to implement.
	 *
	 * This method will result in popping when objects disappear from the frustum, because the shadowmap resolution will
	 * suddenly increase. Cascaded Shadow Maps donâ€™t have this problem, but are harder to implement, and you can still
	 * compensate by smoothing the values over time.
	 *
	 * SDL_Rect has a lot of the needed functionality.
