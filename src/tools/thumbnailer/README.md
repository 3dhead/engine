# Thumbnailer

## Purpose

Create thumbnailer images of all supported voxel formats. In combination with a mimetype definition and a .thumbnailer defintiion file
that must be installed in /usr/share/mime/packages and /usr/share/thumbnailer this will e.g. create small preview images for
vox, qb, qbt, vxm, ... files.

It works for any file manager that supports .thumbnailer entries, including Nautilus, Thunar (when tumbler is installed), Nemo, Caja,
and PCManFM.
